# Spelling Correction Transformer


## About The Project


### Introduction

My project is called **Spelling Correction**. This is a model which helps a person correct a sentence with spelling mistakes.

## Getting Started

To get started, you should have prior knowledge on **Python** and **Pytorch** at first. A few resources to get you started if this is your first Python or Tensorflow project:

- [Pytorch Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)
- [Python for Beginners](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/)


## Installation and Run

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/phkhanhtrinh23/spelling_correction_transformer.git
   ```
  
2. Use any code editor to open the folder **spelling_correction_transformer**.


## Outline

- Input: [`english.txt`](http://www.manythings.org/anki/) a English Dictionary.

- Output:`spelling_correction_transformer` is based on **Transformer Encoder-Decoder** model. It is fast in training and inference. The result is way better than my previous repo [`spelling_correction`](https://github.com/phkhanhtrinh23/spelling_correction)
