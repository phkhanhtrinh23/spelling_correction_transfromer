i didn't mean to give you that impression
i didn't receive even one letter from her
the band is still together
i didn't receive even one letter from her
i didn't receive even one letter from her
what we're doing is dangerous
i don't answer the phone when i'm working
i really enjoyed last night
i don't believe anything those people say
forget about that right now
i don't believe that tom can speak french
i don't feel like studying that all tonight
his suggestion is who considering
i don't have time to answer any questions
i don't have time to do what i want to do
go back to where you belong
i don't have to apologize for what i said
don't use all the hot water
i don't have to apologize for what i said
i don't know anything about riding horses
everyone speaks well of him
i don't know anything about what happened
his neighbors are suspicious of him
i don't know anything about what happened
i don't know how he can live in this mess
i don't know how to say goodbye in french
tom avoid bad breath one should always brush his teeth before meeting an important person
what time is your appointment
what's your favorite sandwich
the bed are uncomfortable
